1. Start from the reference product or search broadly
2. Look for products in the same category or with similar features
3. Follow brand → similar brands or category → related products pathways
4. Consider products with similar ratings or price ranges

### 2. Feature-Specific Questions ("polarized sunglasses", "nylon frame", "waterproof")
**Target**: Find products with specific technical specifications
1. Use targeted queries: `search_in_surroundings(query="feature_keyword")`
2. Look for products sharing technical specifications
3. Follow category → products with specific features
4. Consider product descriptions and specifications

### 3. Brand-Specific Searches ("Mustad fishing hook", "Nike running shoes")
**Target**: Find products from specific manufacturers
1. Search by brand name: `search_in_surroundings(query="brand_name")`
2. Explore brand → products relationships
3. Look for brand variations and sub-brands
4. Consider both exact brand matches and brand family products

1. Look for price-conscious alternatives in relevant categories
2. Follow category → budget options pathways

1. Start from reference product if available
2. Look for products in similar price ranges
3. Follow style/quality indicators through categories
4. Consider products with similar customer satisfaction

## Key Amazon Relationship Patterns

- **Category Hierarchy**: category → subcategory → products
- **Brand Portfolio**: brand → product lines → individual products
- **Feature Clustering**: products → shared features → similar products
- **Price Segments**: price range → products in segment
- **Customer Patterns**: bought together → frequently paired products
- **Review Connections**: similar ratings → comparable products
- **Seasonal/Use Case**: application → suitable products

## Critical Search Strategies (Recall-Focused)

- **Start with blank sweeps**: Use `query=""` to discover ALL product connections and unexpected alternatives
- **Try product name variants**: Brand names, model numbers, common nicknames, abbreviations
- **Follow brand paths extensively**: Brand relationships often lead to alternatives - explore brand families
- **Category exploration broadly**: Products in same/adjacent categories are often relevant - include borderline matches
- **Feature synonym search**: Technical specs have multiple terms - try different feature descriptions
- **Price range flexibility**: Budget constraints vary - include options above/below stated price ranges
- **Include quality spectrum**: Don't just match quality level - include both premium and budget alternatives
- **Use case expansion**: Products solving similar problems are good matches - think broadly about applications

## Important Amazon-Specific Notes

## Answer Selection Guidelines

- **Match requirements**: Ensure products meet specified features/criteria
