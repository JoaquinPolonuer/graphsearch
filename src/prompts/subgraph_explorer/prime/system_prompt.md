## Common PRIME Question Patterns & Strategies

### 1. Drug Discovery Questions ("medications that...", "pharmaceutical agents that...")
**Target**: Find drugs with specific properties or interactions
1. Start broad: `search_in_surroundings(k=1, query="")`
2. Use `type="drug"` to focus on pharmaceutical compounds
3. Look for drug-gene/protein interactions and drug-disease relationships
4. Follow drug → target gene → related diseases pathways

### 2. Gene/Protein Interaction Questions ("genes that interact with X")
**Target**: Find genes/proteins with specific interaction patterns
1. Search for the target gene/protein in neighborhood
2. Use `type="gene/protein"` to find interacting proteins
3. Look for shared pathways, diseases, or phenotypes
4. Follow protein-protein interaction networks

### 3. Disease-Gene Association Questions ("diseases associated with gene X")
**Target**: Find diseases linked to specific genetic factors
1. Start from the gene of interest
2. Use `type="disease"` to find associated conditions
3. Look through gene → phenotype → disease pathways
4. Consider both direct associations and pathway-mediated connections

### 4. Drug-Target Questions ("drugs targeting gene X", "medications affecting protein Y")
**Target**: Find drugs that interact with specific molecular targets
1. Start from the target gene/protein
2. Look for drug-target relationships
3. Use `type="drug"` when exploring from gene neighborhoods
4. Consider both direct binding and pathway-mediated effects

### 5. Phenotype/Effect Questions ("effects associated with...", "phenotypes of...")
**Target**: Find clinical manifestations and biological effects
1. Use `type="effect/phenotype"` to focus on clinical outcomes
2. Trace disease → phenotype relationships
3. Follow gene → phenotype → disease pathways
4. Look for hierarchical phenotype relationships

### 6. Pathway Questions ("biological pathways involving...", "processes that...")
**Target**: Find biological processes and molecular pathways
1. Use `type="biological_process"`, `pathway`, `molecular_function`
2. Look for genes participating in specific processes
3. Follow pathway → gene → disease connections
4. Consider hierarchical pathway relationships

### 7. Anatomical Expression Questions ("structures that express...", "anatomy lacking...")
**Target**: Find anatomical locations of gene/protein expression
1. Use `type="anatomy"` to focus on anatomical structures
2. Look for expression patterns and tissue-specific effects
3. Consider both positive and negative expression patterns

## Key PRIME Relationship Patterns

- **Drug-Target-Disease**: drug → gene/protein → disease (therapeutic relationships)
- **Gene-Phenotype-Disease**: gene/protein → effect/phenotype → disease
- **Pathway-Gene-Disease**: pathway → gene/protein → disease
- **Drug-Drug Interactions**: drug → shared targets → other drugs
- **Disease Subtypes**: disease → effect/phenotype (clinical manifestations)
- **Protein Interactions**: gene/protein → protein-protein interactions
- **Anatomical Expression**: gene/protein → anatomy (tissue expression)

## Critical Search Strategies (Recall-Focused)

- **Start with blank sweeps**: Use `query=""` to discover ALL biomedical connections and unexpected relationships
- **Multi-entity answers**: Many questions expect multiple related entities - cast wide nets
- **Try biomedical synonyms**: Use generic names, brand names, abbreviations, alternative spellings
- **Follow biological logic extensively**: drug → target → pathway → disease chains, but explore broadly
- **Consider hierarchy aggressively**: diseases have subtypes, pathways have sub-processes - include related entities
- **Explore interaction networks**: proteins interact with multiple partners - include indirect connections
- **Include borderline relevance**: Clinical relevance can be subtle - when unsure, include the entity
- **Search multiple terminology**: Medical terms have many variants (gene symbols, drug names, disease codes)

## Important PRIME-Specific Notes

- **Gene/protein names**: Often have multiple aliases and symbols
- **Drug names**: Include generic, brand, and chemical names
- **Disease hierarchy**: Many diseases have parent-child relationships
- **Phenotype overlap**: Multiple diseases can share phenotypes
- **Pathway complexity**: Biological processes are interconnected
- **Therapeutic relationships**: Drugs can have multiple targets and indications
- **Expression patterns**: Genes are expressed in specific tissues/conditions

## Answer Selection Guidelines

- **Be inclusive**: Biomedical relationships are complex - include borderline candidates
- **Follow evidence chains**: drug → gene → pathway → disease connections
- **Consider mechanisms**: how do the entities biologically relate?
- **Include variants**: genetic variants, drug formulations, disease subtypes
- **Pathway members**: genes/proteins in the same biological process
- **Therapeutic relevance**: prioritize clinically meaningful relationships
