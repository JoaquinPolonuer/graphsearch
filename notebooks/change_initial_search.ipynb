Wolman disease is characterized by neonatal abdominal distension, major or even massive hepatosplenomegaly and calcified adrenal glands, cholesteryl ester storage disease presents with microvesicular steatosis leading to hepatomegaly and hypercholesterolaemia with subsequent liver failure and accelerated atherosclerosis.\\n  - umls_description: The severe infantile form of inherited lysosomal lipid storage diseases due to deficiency of acid lipase It is characterized by the accumulation of neutral lipids, particularly cholesterol esters in leukocytes, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes. It is also known as Wolman's xanthomatosis and is an allelic variant of cholesterol ester storage disease.\\n  - orphanet_definition: A rare, progressive metabolic liver disease due to marked to complete lysosomal acid lipase deficiency and characterized by dyslipidemia and massive lipid accumulation leading to hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction, splenomegaly, accelerated atherosclerosis.\\n  - orphanet_prevalence: 1-9/100000\\n  - orphanet_epidemiology: Based on allele frequency, worldwide birth prevalence is estimated at 1/177000; however, birth prevalence is lower in populations with Finnish, Ashkenazi Jewish, and South or East Asian ancestry.\\n  - orphanet_clinical_description: Presentation is along a clinical continuum with variable rates of progression and severity. The early-onset, rapidly progressive form, Wolman disease, presents in the neonatal or infantile period with non-specific symptoms of massive hepatosplenomegaly, liver failure, diarrhea/steatorrhea and vomiting, resulting in malabsorption, and cachexia. Adrenal calcifications occur in approximately half of infants. The later onset form, cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), presents between childhood and adulthood with a more variable clinical course that ranges from insidious to symptomatic. Progressive lysosomal lipid accumulation leads to the characteristic liver pathology and dysfunction (including hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis and/or cirrhosis, and elevated serum transaminases), dyslipidemia (elevated serum LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, with normal to low HDL-cholesterol concentrations), premature atherosclerosis, splenomegaly and, eventually, end-stage liver failure. Secondary complications are variable and may include portal hypertension, ascites, cachexia, esophageal varices, gastrointestinal bleeding, coronary artery disease, aneurysm, stroke, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Approximately one-third of children experience severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including frequent diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malabsorption and steatorrhoea.\\n  - orphanet_management_and_treatment: Supportive measures include statins and cholestyramine to cholesterol, and liver transplant for end-stage liver failure. Patients should follow a diet low in cholesterol and triglycerides, and nutritional status should be monitored.. Magnetic resonance imaging to assess liver and spleen volumes may be useful. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with the enzyme sebelipase alfa (authorized in Europe and the US) is available; however, the long-term clinical efficacy is yet to be determined. In infants with severe disease, ERT improves 1-year survival rates. In patients with later-onset disease, ERT reduces alanine aminotransferase levels and liver fat content, and improves the lipid parameters. Anemia and thrombocytopenia should be treated with standard approaches.\\n\",\n",

Patients tend to be born preterm. Hyperkeratosis is usually present at birth and progresses to a generalized ichthyosis, particularly prominent on flexural areas, the nape of the neck, the trunk and the extremities. Pruritus is a prominent feature. Erythematous dermatitis is often present at birth, and then tends to fade with increasing age. Neurological signs appear during the first two years of life and consist of delay in reaching motor milestones due to spastic diplegia or, much less commonly, spastic tetraplegia. Approximately one-half of patients are non-ambulatory. Seizures occur in about 40% of cases. Intellectual deficit varies from mild to severe, although rare patients with normal intellect have been reported. Delayed speech and dysarthria are common. Ophthalmologic involvement is often present and is characterized by retinal crystalline inclusions (so-called glistening white dots) surrounding the fovea. Photophobia and myopia are common.\\n  - orphanet_management_and_treatment: Management should be multidisciplinary including neurologists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons, and physiotherapists. The treatment of ichthyosis consists of topical application of moisturizing creams and keratolytic agents, or use of systemic retinoids. Seizures usually respond to anti-convulsant medications and spasticity is alleviated by botulinum toxin injections or surgical procedures. Special diets with medium-chain fatty acid supplements may help the ichthyosis, but effects are limited.\\n',\n",

Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment aims to control symptoms and blood triglyceride levels with a very low-fat diet. Treatment for individual symptoms (i.e. pancreatitis) involves following established treatment guidelines.\\n  - umls_description: rare familial condition characterized by massive chylomicronemia and decreased levels of other lipoproteins; due to deficiency of lipoprotein lipase, an alkaline triglyceride hydrolase which catalyzes an important step in the extrahepatic removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the blood.\\n  - orphanet_prevalence: 1-9/1000000\\n',\n",

It is characterized by the presence of a defective protein called octn2 which is involved in the transportation of carnitine into the cells. This abnormality results in reduced energy production and accumulation of fatty acids in the tissues. Clinical manifestations of confusion, muscle weakness, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy may be exacerbated during fasting.\\n  - orphanet_definition: A disorder of carnitine cycle and carnitine transport that is characterized classically by early childhood onset cardiomyopathy often with weakness and hypotonia, failure to thrive and recurrent hypoglycemic hypoketotic seizures and/or coma.\\n  - orphanet_epidemiology: Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) exact prevalence is unknown and varies depending on ethnicity. The estimated prevalence is 1/20000 - 1/70000 newborns in Europe and the USA while the estimated incidence in Japan is 1/40000 births. In the Faroe Islands, the prevalence is 1/1300 and the incidence is 1/720.\\n  - orphanet_clinical_description: Disease onset typically occurs in infancy between the ages of 3 months to 2 years. Infants often present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, poor feeding, irritability, lethargy, and hepatomegaly, triggered by fasting stress or common illnesses including gastoenteritis and respiratory tract infections. Roughly half of clinically presenting patients present with muscle hypotonia and progressive childhood cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. Anemia is sometimes observed as carnitine plays a role in red blood cell metabolism. Adulthood presentation is associated with minor symptoms like fatigue and decreased stamina but dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death have also been reported. Asymptomatic adults are also described. During pregnancy, minor symptoms as well as cardiac arrhythmias can worsen.\\n  - orphanet_management_and_treatment: Carnitine therapy is the standard treatment. Oral levocarnitine (L-carnitine) supplementation of 100-400 mg/kg/day in three divided doses is usually required. Oral carnitine treatment is required for lifelong treatment of the disease.\\n',\n",

ST-2 displays a broad spectrum of clinical severity with antenatal/congenital, infantile and juvenile presentations.\\n  - orphanet_prevalence: <1/1000000\\n  - orphanet_epidemiology: The prevalence of ST-2 is unknown. The prevalence of sialidosis (types 1 and 2 combined) has been estimated at approximately 1/5000000-1/1500000 live births.\\n  - orphanet_clinical_description: ST-2 has a wide range of clinical manifestations and is usually divided into congenital/antenatal, infantile and juvenile forms. The congenital/antenatal form is characterized by non-immune hydrops fetalis, or ascites, presenting in utero or at birth and by the development of a mucopolysaccharidosis (see this term)-like phenotype including coarse facial features, dysostosis multiplex, hepatosplenomegaly, and umbilical and inguinal hernias. Surviving children and patients with the infantile onset form (before 12 months of age) are characterized by a mucopolysaccharidosis-like phenotype that includes coarse facies, dysosotosis multiplex, kyphosis, short stature (with a slowing of growth towards 18 months of age), hepatosplenomegaly, hearing impairment, cherry-red spot on the retina (a constant feature after 3 years of age), corneal opacities (rarely) and speech and developmental delay, followed by psychomotor regression and myoclonus and ataxia in some cases. Renal disease (nephrosialidosis) has been reported in some patients. The juvenile form usually presents after the age of 2 with less pronounced coarse facies, angiokeratoma, myoclonic seizures, macular cherry red spots, and psychomotor regression.\\n  - orphanet_management_and_treatment: There is no cure for ST-2 and management is multidisciplinary involving mainly palliative care. Anti-convulsants may be used to treat myoclonic seizures, but are only rarely effective. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has not been successful in preventing psychomotor regression, bone changes or nephrosialidosis.\\n',\n",
